# C++ Mini Projects

Welcome to the C++ Mini Projects repository! This repository contains three beginner-friendly C++ projects that are great for learning the basics of C++ programming. Each project is designed to be simple yet effective in demonstrating core C++ concepts like control structures, functions, and basic input/output operations.

## Projects

### 1. Number Guessing Game

**Description**: The Number Guessing Game is a simple game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100. The player has to guess the number, and after each guess, the program provides feedback indicating whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

**Features**:
- Random number generation between 1 and 100.
- Input validation to ensure the player enters a number.
- Feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- Tracks the number of attempts.

**How to Play**:
1. Run the program.
2. Enter your guess when prompted.
3. The game will tell you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
4. Keep guessing until you find the correct number!

**Key Concepts**:
- `if-else` statements for decision-making.
- Loops for repeated guessing.
- Random number generation using `rand()`.

### 2. Simple Calculator

**Description**: The Simple Calculator is a basic calculator program that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operations. The calculator interacts with the user in a human-like manner, providing friendly prompts and feedback.

**Features**:
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operations.
- Input validation to ensure correct number entry.
- Friendly and conversational interaction style.
- Option to exit the program.

**How to Use**:
1. Run the program.
2. Choose the operation you want to perform from the menu.
3. Enter two numbers when prompted.
4. The calculator will display the result of the operation.
5. Continue performing operations or exit the program.

**Key Concepts**:
- Functions for modularity and code organization.
- Basic arithmetic operations.
- Error handling for user input.

### 3. Tic-Tac-Toe Game

**Description**: The Tic-Tac-Toe Game is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking a 3x3 grid with 'X' or 'O'. The first player to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins. If all nine squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game is a tie.

**Features**:
- Two-player mode with no AI.
- Simple 3x3 grid interface.
- Input validation to prevent overwriting moves.
- Checks for winning conditions after each move.
- Declares the winner or if the game is a tie.

**How to Play**:
1. Run the program.
2. Player 1 selects their marker ('X' or 'O').
3. Players take turns entering the number corresponding to the grid position where they want to place their marker.
4. The game checks for a winner after each move.
5. The game ends when a player wins or the grid is full.

**Key Concepts**:
- 2D arrays for the game board.
- Loops and conditionals for game flow control.
- Basic game logic for detecting wins and ties.

## Getting Started

To run these projects, you'll need a C++ compiler. You can use any IDE like Code::Blocks, Visual Studio, or an online compiler. Simply copy the code for the project you're interested in, paste it into your C++ environment, and run the program.
